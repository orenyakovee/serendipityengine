# Contributing to the Serendipity Engine

> **Support the Revolution** – Information liberation needs resources, infrastructure, and sustained development.  
> Whether you’re sharing an idea, polishing copy, or eventually writing code, every contribution helps break down the walls of digital apartheid.

## 📌 Current State of the Project

At this moment the repository consists mainly of static HTML that describes the vision and provides a live demo. There is **no functional JavaScript code yet**, but we are actively planning the architecture, design, and feature set.

Because of this early stage, the most valuable contributions right now are **ideas, design mock‑ups, copy edits, documentation, and infrastructure suggestions**. Traditional bug reports and code pull requests will become appropriate once a minimal code scaffold is added.

## 🛠️ How You Can Contribute Right Now

| Contribution type | What to do | Where to submit |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Feature ideas & specifications** | Describe a concrete feature (e.g., a new content source, multilingual support, privacy tool). Include user flow, data requirements, and any references. | Open an issue using the **Feature Idea** template. |
| **Design & UX mock‑ups** | Create wireframes, UI sketches, or interactive prototypes (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or even hand‑drawn PNGs). Explain the intended user experience. | Attach the mock‑up to a **Design Mock‑up** issue. |
| **Copy & content editing** | Proofread the landing page, “About/Contribute” section, or any Markdown files. Improve clarity, grammar, and tone. | Submit a pull request that modifies only the HTML/Markdown files. |
| **Documentation scaffolding** | Expand the `README`, add a `ROADMAP.md`, or write a `TESTING.md` that outlines how you’d validate the engine’s randomness, crawling, etc. | Add a new Markdown file via a pull request. |
| **Infrastructure & ops suggestions** | Propose cloud providers, Docker compose files, IPFS node setups, or global crawler architectures. Include diagrams or config snippets. | Open an **Infrastructure Proposal** issue. |
| **Legal & advocacy input** | Offer advice on licensing, privacy policies, or strategies for a legal defense fund. | Discuss in an issue labeled `legal`. |

### General Workflow for Non‑Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository** (click the **Fork** button on GitHub).  
2. **Clone your fork** locally (optional for documentation edits).  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your‑github‑username>/serendipityengine.git
   cd serendipityengine
Copy
Create a branch (e.g., feature‑idea‑search‑filters).

git checkout -b feature-idea-search-filters
Copy
Make your changes (edit Markdown, add images, write a proposal).

Commit with a clear message.

git add .
git commit -m "Add design mock‑up for homepage carousel"
Copy
Push and open a Pull Request.

git push origin feature-idea-search-filters
Copy
Fill out the PR template – briefly explain what you added and why it matters.

Engage in review – maintainers may ask for clarification; iterate as needed.

🐞 Bug Reports & Code Contributions (Future Phase)
When they become appropriate: After a minimal JavaScript scaffold (e.g., a src/app.js that loads a random item) is merged, the repository will accept traditional bug reports and code PRs.
What to expect then:
Use the Bug Report template for crashes, UI glitches, or unexpected behavior.
Follow the same fork‑branch‑PR workflow described above for code changes.
Until that scaffold exists, feel free to open an issue titled “Premature bug report” to discuss any observed problems with the static site, but know that functional fixes will wait for the code base to grow.

💰 Funding & Donations (Optional)
Your financial support accelerates every pillar of the project:

🔹	Pillar	What Your Money Enables
🌐	Global Server Infrastructure	Deploy crawler nodes worldwide, bypass geo‑restrictions, and provide truly global knowledge access.
🔧	Full‑Time Development	Allow core developers to work exclusively on the engine, shrinking timelines from years to months.
🛡️	Security Audits & Privacy	Commission professional security reviews and implement cutting‑edge cryptography.
💾	Distributed Storage Network	Run IPFS nodes and decentralized storage so knowledge stays accessible even under attack.
🎨	Professional Design & UX	Hire world‑class designers to make complex discovery tools approachable for everyone.
⚖️	Legal Defense Fund	Defend the project against corporate or governmental legal challenges.
🌍	Multi‑National Grant Discovery & Application Assistance	Identify, apply for, and manage international research and innovation grants that can fund large‑scale infrastructure and staffing.
Transparency: All funding will be publicly tracked and reported.
