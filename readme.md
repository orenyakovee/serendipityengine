# Serendipity Engine

**A lightweight web app that surfaces random, unexpected pieces of knowledge from across the internet.**  
Our goal is to build a “telescope” for human curiosity—an open‑source platform that breaks down information silos, respects privacy, and runs on a globally distributed infrastructure.

> **Support the Revolution** – Information liberation requires resources, infrastructure, and sustained development. Every contribution—idea, design, code, or funding—helps dismantle digital apartheid.

## Demo

Visit the live prototype:  
**https://orenyakovee.github.io/serendipityengine/**  

The page currently displays an informational overview and a button that will eventually trigger the random‑content generator.

---

## Vision & Goals

1. **Universal Access** – Deploy crawler nodes worldwide to bypass geo‑restrictions and deliver truly global knowledge.  
2. **Privacy‑First Architecture** – Use encrypted protocols, IPFS storage, and anonymity networks (Tor/I2P/Freenet) to keep user data private.  
3. **Open‑Source Sustainability** – Build a community‑driven codebase funded by transparent donations, grants, and institutional partnerships.  
4. **Serendipitous Discovery** – Combine AI‑enhanced ranking, multilingual support, and visualisation tools to surface unexpected, high‑value content.  

---

## Current Status

- **Static HTML prototype** with project description, vision, and contact information.  
- No functional JavaScript engine yet; architecture and feature set are being designed.  
- Community contributions are welcomed in the form of ideas, designs, documentation, and infrastructure proposals.

---

## How to Get Involved

### Idea & Design Contributions

- **Feature ideas** – Submit an issue using the *Feature Idea* template. Outline the user flow, data sources, and any references.  
- **Design mock‑ups** – Share wireframes, UI sketches, or interactive prototypes (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, PNGs). Attach them to a *Design Mock‑up* issue.

### Documentation & Copy Editing

- Proofread the landing page, “About/Contribute” section, or any Markdown files.  
- Expand the `README`, add a `ROADMAP.md`, or write a `TESTING.md` that describes validation strategies.  
- Submit changes via a pull request that touches only documentation files.

### Future Code Contributions

Once a minimal JavaScript scaffold (e.g., `src/app.js` that loads a random item) is merged, the repository will accept:

- **Bug reports** – Use the *Bug Report* template for crashes or UI glitches.  
- **Feature PRs** – Fork, branch, implement, and submit a pull request following the standard workflow.  

> *Until that scaffold exists, feel free to open an issue titled “Premature bug report” to discuss any observed problems with the static site.*
